# My_Monokai_Theme
# for Visual Studio Code

Hello hello!!

My name is Jasa, and I customized this theme that is already installed by default.

You must go to the Manage button, click here, and then go to the option who says "Settings".
So, go to the upper right corner, and select the option that when you put the mouse over, it says "Open Settings (JSON)".

Thereafter, check the settings you have in this file.
Below them, paste the code that I have placed in this repository.

In any case, you can leave a comment.
